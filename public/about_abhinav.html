<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>My name is Abhinav Pandey and i hail from the holy city Kashi(Varanasi),UP which is also considered an abode of Lord Shiva on earth.
   My father is a Government officer, my mother is a Homemaker and and my brother works as a Software developer in a reputed organisation.
   I am currently pursuing my B.tech course in Information Technology from Abes Engineering College, Ghaziabad, UP and had done my initial<br />schooling from St.John's and LFH school from Varanasi itself.<br />
   I have particular interests in learning about and listening to diiferent genres of music, and i am deeply intrigued 'bout cosmos and<br />always ready to know more.<br />
   My weakness is that i can be a slow learner at times but my strenght just overshadows it cause i have very picturisque memory and i am<br />great at applying my learned skills.<br />
   And my moto of life is very simple, just live happily and let others live happily 'cause life is too short to argue.<br />
   And at last i would like to conclude by saying that my inspiration for life is a future better version of myself 'cause that's how i can<br />keep myself motivated towards a better goal every single day of my life.
